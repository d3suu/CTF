"CrackMe 2 x64 ELF" aka "I never forget the Nintendo 64"

So you got a compiled ELF file, running it shows "Password:" and waits for input, then says "Wrong password!" or shows flag if you got much luck.

Let's decompile it using gdb,
on 0x4006ef there is cmp instruction which compares two values (input and programmed value imo) and then, there is jne which will kick us to the "Wrong password!" output if these two values aren't equal.

Let's be lazy and don't even look at the rest of the code, set breakpoint to first instruction in main block, now enter ni (next instruction) till you'll be on cmp address. Now look at the registers (inf register), cmp compares eax and edx, so we have to change the value of one of these (or both, who cares). Now just simply ni till you got your flag and vuala, done.

Note to self (and maybe you):
Keep things simple.
